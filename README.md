# OpenAIGym-s-CarRacing-Game-using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

Abstract—Automated cars and vehicles pose a pressing and
challenging technical problem. In this work a car navigation system, in a randomly generated racetrack, was developed using deep reinforcement learning techniques such as Deep Q-learning (DQN) and the OpenAI Gym environment. A reward system and a custom CNN model as a DQN was developed and experimented with a lot of hyper-parameter tuning, model architectures, and input image processing. Car navigation is integral to many current automated systems. In this project focus is on the problem of teaching an agent – an “intelligent” car – how to navigate independently around a simulated race track. The car has to take actions (turn, accelerate, and brake certain magnitudes) to follow the grey-marked path and complete the randomly generated track, all while doing so as quickly as possible. Car navigation has a multitude of practical applications and is a challenging and pressing problem that many autonomous vehicle companies are trying to tackle. The current system though running needs further tuning in order to enhance the performance to match that of a state of the art model.
